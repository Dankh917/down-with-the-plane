# down-with-the-plane
my first ever project in programming and specifically with python.
the project is a game I worked on called "down with the plane" , the aim is to get the highest score 
you can achieve by downing/shooting the green/enemy plane .
the game ends when the green plane manges to land a missile on the blue plane  (the plane you control).
in order to restart the game press "Z"

*the game was made with python using pygame.
